This project uses a LD2410C Millimeter Wave Radar Sensor module and an ESP32 to detect if a person is in a room. If there is a person in the room it will turn on some led light strips and turn on a light switch. As soon as the preson leaves the room the lights all turn off.
Hardware:
ESP32 Development Board GPIO Breakout Board 
HLK-LD2410
Kasa Smart Light Switch HS200
Led light strip
12v power supply 
Mosfet and resistors
